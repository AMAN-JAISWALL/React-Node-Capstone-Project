# React-Node-Capstone-Project
My capstone project is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MySQL as the database. The application offers a seamless user experience with a dynamic interface powered by React, while Node.js and Express handle server-side logic, routing, and API management.
